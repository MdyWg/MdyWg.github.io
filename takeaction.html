      <h2 class="subtitle">2. Choose sustainable seafood</h2>
      <p class="subdescription">Choosing to buy certified seafood that comes from a sustainable fishery incentivises more sustainable fishing practices through encouraging retailers to stock more sustainable food. You can determine which seafood is sustainable through <a href="https://www.msc.org/en-us/what-you-can-do/eat-sustainable-seafood/sustainable-species">MSC certifications</a> or by looking up the company to check their fishing practices. If you are curious about incorporating these types of seafood into your diet, there are guides and <a href="https://www.msc.org/en-us/what-you-can-do/eat-sustainable-seafood/sustainable-speciesrecipes online">recipes</a> online.</p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">3. Reduce your food waste</h2>
      <p class="subdescription">Maybe this might seem simple, but by reducing food waste and consuming less seafood, it also helps with overfishing. That means cooking and storing seafood in better ways to cut down on the amount used, and not necessarily cutting seafood out of your diet entirely.</p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">4. Donate to fund environmental organizations:</h2>
      <p class="subdescription">You can show support directly by <a href="donate.html">donating today.</a></p>
